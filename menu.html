<p>Growing up in a multigenerational household, I've had the rare privilege of experiencing
     diverse perspectives on life from my grandparents, parents, and siblings. My grandparents,
     who emigrated from Kilifi, taught me the importance of staying true to our cultural heritage
      and maintaining strong connections with family. Daily rituals like preparing and enjoying 
      traditional milikenda's meals, participating in Lunar New Year celebrations, and listening to 
      stories about my grandparents' journey to the Machakos helped me appreciate the strength
       and resilience of my ancestors.</p>

   <p> However, this cultural pride was not always something I cherished. As a child, I was bullied for
     my Banh Khot and Banh Mi lunches, and I'd often ask my parents to pack more generic-looking
      sandwiches to avoid feeling like an outsider at school. It wasn't until my grandmother shared
      
      her own story of assimilation and how she strived to maintain her cultural identity in a new
       country that I realized the value of embracing my heritage. Inspired by her courage, I decided
        to educate my peers about mijikenda traditions and founded a cultural exchange club at school.
         Together, we explored our heritages, organizing potlucks, cultural presentations, and language 
         exchange sessions.</p>
    
    <p> Through this experience, I've learned that embracing who I am and the unique background I come
     from has made me a stronger person. My personal background has taught me to be open to learning
      about other cultures, which I look forward to bringing to my future college community.</p>


<h1 id="personal statement">Personal Statement</h1>
<p>I have always had an interest in the way things work, and since I was young, science has beenone 
  of my favourite subjects. My interest in sciences, particularly physics, has developedthroughout 
  my time at school, and I enjoy the challenge of using scientific and mathematicalideas when 
  solving everyday problems. Last year I took part in the Engineering EducationScheme, working 
  alongside three other students, with the local water company, to work on aproject involving the 
  removal of sludge from a drinking water clarification tank. </p>
  <p>This helped meto develop time 
  management, problem-solving and teamwork skills, as we encountered severalproblems along the way
   (mostly involving the sludge), as well as having to cope with each other for long hours in order
    to meet deadlines. I found this both challenging and rewarding, andachieved a Gold Crest Award 
    as well as being able to take part in the regional final of the YoungEngineers for Britain 
    competition. The scheme gave me a useful insight into the types of problems that engineers have 
    to solve, and convinced me that engineering is the career path Iwant to follow. I aim to secure
     sponsorship for my course with a local company, as this willprovide me with experience of 
     industrial work during the holidays, as well as helping mefinancially through my time at 
     university.I believe that good links between engineers and businesses are essential for an 
     efficient andprofitable future for British industry.</p>
     <p> Studying Economics to AS-level, along with
      sciences andmaths, has helped me to understand some of the scientific principles behind 
      production andmanagement techniques. Physics has taught me about how things behave, and how 
      theseproperties can be used in solving both practical and theoretical situations. Studying 
      biology hashelped me to appreciate the role that engineers can play in helping to balance 
      industry andnatural environment. My favourite part of the course is the environment module, 
      as I enjoylearning about how different species can adapt to their surroundings. Mathematics
       gives me theopportunity to apply familiar concepts to unfamiliar situations, and I enjoy the
        challenge of solving mathematical problems. I also find further maths enjoyable, as I find 
        it more challengingthan my normal maths lessons.</p>
        <p> Alongside my school work, I have been 
        studying an Open University science short course
entitled “Food and Health: A Chemical Story”. I enjoy working on the course, as it helps to
broaden my scientific reading, and covers interesting topics in more depth than my schoolstudies. 
It also helps me with my independent study and time management skills. I am due tocomplete the
 course at the end of October.I like to be involved in other aspects of school life, for example 
 I took part in the junior mock trialcompetition lower down the school. Last year I was assistant
  house captain, helping toencourage younger members of my house in competitions. I helped backstage
   in the sixth form
show, which I intend to do again this year. I am a year eight “buddy”, which involves helping an
able younger student with extra schoolwork. </p>
<p>I take drama lessons out of school, and recentlypassed
 Guildhall Grade 6 solo acting with honours. I have been involved in five musicals since
starting at this school, and am currently rehearsing for my first principal role in the 
schools’ production of “Les Miserables”. I have also taken part in several pro
ductions with local youththeatre and amateur dramatics societies, ranging from William Shakespeare 
to Willy Russell. Iplay the violin in the school orchestra, and enjoy singing in the school choir. 
I also take part inmusic activities outside of school, and am involved in groups such as Burton 
Sinfonia andStaffordshire Youth Choir. Although at the moment I intend to complete a degree in 
manufacturing engineering, I do notfeel that I am in the best position to make any final decisions 
about my career yet, and havechosen courses with the first year (and in some cases the second year)
 common to degree programmes in many disciplines of engineering. My experiences of engineering so far havebeen both 
  challenging and rewarding, and I hope that my future career will be too.</p>
