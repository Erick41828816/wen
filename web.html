    <p> My world is built on a foundation of tradition, duty, and social responsibility. 
            I thrive in structured environments where roles and expectations are clear, and I take great
            pride in fulfilling my obligations. My organizational skills are top-notch, allowing to juggle multiple 
            responsibilities with apparent ease, whether it’s planning a family gathering or coordinating a 
            work project.

     <p>“Greetings, Erick Chugu, a junior enrolled in the Electrical and electronics Engineering program at
        Machakos University. My academic pursuits are centered around the intricate field of Engineering, 
        where I dedicate my time to unraveling complex problems and advancing technological
        solutions. Beyond the classroom, I actively participate in the Men in Tech club,
        advocating for gender diversity and inclusivity within the technology sector. 
        Additionally, I am an enthusiast of gastronomy, indulging in culinary explorations to 
        broaden my palate and cultural awareness. My professional aspirations entail securing a
        position within a leading tech corporation, where I aspire to contribute innovative ideas 
        and foster positive change within the industry.”</p>

    <h1 class="h1">HERE IS MY EDUCATION BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>In my professional life, I shine brightest in roles that allow me to combine 
        other people's skills with my organizational abilities. I thrive in environments where 
        I can directly see the positive impact of my work on others, be it
        in healthcare, education, hospitality, or human resources. My strong work ethic,
        reliability, and attention to detail make me a valued team member in any place.

        However, my need for stability and appreciation can sometimes hold me back from taking
        risks or pursuing advancement opportunities. I may find yourself staying in a comfortable
        but unfulfilling job longer than I should, out of a sense of loyalty or fear of change. 
        Learning to step out of my comfort zone and advocating for my own professional growth 
        are crucial steps in my career development.

    <h2>Erick Ngua Chugu</h2>
    <p>Electrical and Electronics Engineer</p>
    <h2  class="h2">THIS IS ABOUT ME</h2>
    
    <p class="p">Hello, hope this finds you well! My name is Erick and in the Fall of 2028 I will be
     a junior in the field of engineering, with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering, 
     and minor in biology. I was born and raised in Coatal region, in the county  of Kilifi,Jaribuni.
      When I was a sophomore in high school, I decided that I would like to pursue a degree in a
       higher level of education in this country. It is not an easy decision to make. It involves 
       a lot of research, dedication, and sacrifice in order to achieve this goal. What is truly 
       important is to never give up, because like everything else in life, this journey is never 
       easy. With the support of my family and friends, and with the passion in my heart, 
       this goal is achievable. If I put your mind to it, I will be successful. The whole process
        of coming here, from finding the right school, to various applications, and preparation to 
        leave my county, is a time consuming effort; but take my word for it, it is in every sense 
        of the word a life changing experience, that is worth the while. <br>


        I got accepted to most of the schools that I applied to, but Machakos University is a place
        that I would like to find a new home at. Everyone I talked to through emails were highly 
        professional, which gave me a sense of security, like I can count on people in the community
         if I ever experience difficulties. Being an athlete, it was important to me to continue that
         
        chapter of my life. I am a proud Eagle in Machakos's football and basketball team, as well 
        as the outdoor track and field. Being a member in a sports team as well as an active member
         of International Student Association, gave me a sense of community as well as an opportunity to meet some amazing people from all over the globe. Those connections that you form between fellow students and faculty make you a better person in a way that broadens your spectrum of how different cultures work, and what is your place in this world.
        
        It is extremely difficult to single out what is my favorite thing about Machakos, or what is
         my fondest memory. I had a unique opportunity to travel all around the country with my 
         sports teams, and to explore new places. I am being taught by great scientists that are
          becoming my inspiration for my future career path. And lastly, and most importantly, I met
         friends who became my family away from home. <br>

        
        I don’t have a single moment of regret for coming here. University experience is a great way
        to prepare yourself for adulthood. For me, there is no better place to do so than at Machakos's 
        close community, where you can always find people that will help you through some tough times.
         It is never easy, but don’t give up. If anyone reading this decides to become a Machakos student,
          I can’t wait until I meet you. <br>
        
        All the best, <br>
        
        Erick Chugu '20   <br> </p>
